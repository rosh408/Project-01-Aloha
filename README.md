# Aloha Project 1

Key notes: Started off with moble implementation. As my HTML, CSS and JS were implemented on the mobile version, I finished the project off with media queries. Double checked for any extraenous comments for organization.

## Header Section

Contains: Logo, Icon, and Navigation.

Used flex properties to spread out the header items. What I found really helpful were the "order" properties. It helped me re-arranged the items however i wanted them to. Justify contents and flex wrap properties were two other flex properties that helped me re-arranged the header section.

## Main Section 

Contains: Banner, Hand-Crafted Styles Text, Categories, Carousel, and Subscription News letter.

Used background image properties for my banner.

Inside the 'submit' event listener, if else statements were added to make sure the email input had the following: '@' and '.com'.

## Footer Section

Had a hard time with the social media navigation expanding but i got it to work eventually through using PX instead of REM
