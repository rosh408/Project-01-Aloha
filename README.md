# Aloha Project 1

Key notes: Started off with moble implementation. As my HTML, CSS and JS were implemented on the mobile version, I finished the project off with media queries. Double checked for any extraenous comments for organization.

## Header Section

Contains: Logo, Icon, and Navigation.

Used flex properties to spread out the header items. What I found really helpful were the "order" properties. It helped me re-arranged the items however i wanted them to. Justify contents and flex wrap properties were two other flex properties that helped me re-arranged the header section.

## Main Section 

Contains: Banner, Hand-Crafted Styles Text, Categories, Carousel, and Subscription News letter.



## Footer Section
